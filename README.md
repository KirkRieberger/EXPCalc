# EXPCalc

## Overview
This is a personal project striving to learn more about the mechanics of the Pokemon games by building an experience point (EXP) calculator in Python.
This also serves as a learning experience with the Python windowing library Tkinter.

### EXPCalc.py
This was the first iteration of the calculator. It is fully command-line based. The initial testing using generation 3 Pokemon is the only EXP calculation present. This program has evolved into a utility program of sorts allowing me to convert my work in Python to Java and XML for developing an Android app based around the same concept.

### EXPWithGUI.pyw
This was my first attempt at using any sort of windowing library, and it's a little rough around the edges. But it works, I think.
